TLDC 
================

OpenTLDC is an algorithm for tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained video streams. 
It is based on TLD, published by Zdenek Kalal. 
It does not depend on any training data, it learns and detects objects in real time.

License
================

TLDC is released under the GPL license version 3.0. For more info see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt

Installing
================

1.) TLDC requires the following libraries:
- OpenCV 2.1 (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/)
- Eigen 3.0.2 (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

2.) Modify Makefile
- Edit paths to eigen3 and OpenCV libraries in line 2:
	INCLUDES := -OPENCVPATH -EIGEN3PATH

3.) make

Usage
================

tldc [args]

[-x] : Initial boundingbox x-positions, expects two values (xmin xmax)
[-y] : Initial boundingbox y-positions, expects two values (ymin ymax)
[-vid] : Uses videosource, expects path to source ("/home/.....")
[-cam] : Uses camera as source, expects index of camera
[-nodisplay] : Turns output window off
[-fr] : First frame index of video stream

Example:
./tldc -vid "/home/tldc/test.avi" -fr 1061 -x 310 380 -y 110 200
